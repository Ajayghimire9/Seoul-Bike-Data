Required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
# Bike Rental Prediction

This Python script aims to predict bike rentals for enhancing urban mobility. The prediction of bike counts required at each hour plays a vital role in ensuring a stable supply of rental bikes, thereby reducing waiting times.

## Introduction

Rental bikes in urban cities provide enhanced mobility and convenience. The code's primary objective is predicting the required bike count per hour to ensure an adequate and accessible supply of rental bikes.

## Data Collection

The script utilizes bike rental data from a CSV file ("SeoulBikeData.csv") located in the directory "Data/SeoulBikeData.csv".

## Data Preprocessing and Analysis

The dataset includes features such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, snowfall, wind speed, visibility, solar radiation, dew point temperature, and more. The code preprocesses the data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and analyzes various statistical measures, distributions, correlations, and categorical variables.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves transforming variables, handling outliers, analyzing distributions, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.

## Model Building

The script builds several regression models, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Bagging Regressor, and Stacking Regressor. It evaluates these models based on R-squared scores, Mean Squared Error (MSE), cross-validation accuracy, and standard deviation.

## Results and Model Comparison

The code presents a comparative analysis of model performance using metrics such as R-squared, MSE, cross-validation accuracy, and standard deviation. The models are ranked based on their performance to determine the most effective model for predicting bike rentals.

## File Structure

- `Bike_Rental_Prediction.py`: Python script containing the entire prediction pipeline.
- `Data/SeoulBikeData.csv`: CSV file containing the bike rental data.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the code and usage instructions.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the Python script `Bike_Rental_Prediction.py`.
3. Ensure the required libraries and dataset are available to execute the code.

## Acknowledgments

The code utilizes bike rental data for predictive analysis. Adjustments may be required based on specific datasets or model optimizations.
